Use CIFAR-10 dataset,
a. Implement a 6-layer CNN network (Choose your own architecture) to perform classification, use the same training and testing data split as given in the dataset, Report the following
  i. Accuracy on test data by varying the Optimization Techniques
    1. Vanilla SGD
    2. SGD with momentum
    3. Adam
  ii. Accuracy on test data by varying the Normalization Techniques
    1. Dropout
    2. Batch Normalization
  iii. Accuracy on test data by varying activation function in between CNN layers ,
    1. Identity
    2. Sigmoid
    3. ReLU
    4. Tanh
  iv. Accuracy on test data by varying the loss functions
    1. Cross-Entropy Loss 
    2. MSELoss
    3. L1 Loss

Find the best configuration for your CNN (a combination of Optimization Technique, Normalization technique, activation function and Loss function), support your claim.

Training the following classifiers:

1. Half Space (own implementation)
2. Logistic Regression (using an inbuilt function)
3. SVM classifier (using a linear kernel)
4. SVM classifier (using a Polynomial kernel and a Gaussian kernel)
5. Logistic Regression using the SGD procedure.

Comparing and analyzing the results obtained by using the different classifiers.

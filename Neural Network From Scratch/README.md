Implementing a 3-class backpropagation NNet on your own to classify iris data, i.e. from scratch. 


(a) varying the learning rate and showing the best learning rate value when running it for 50 epochs.

(b) varying the number of epochs from 10 to 100 in a step of 10 and showing the loss value curve (using the best learning r
ate obtained from (a))

(c) adding L2 regularization - showing the comparisons with and without this regularization and analyzing results.
